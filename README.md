# Simple Quiz App

This is another console project. The project helps to practice arrays and loops

If you wanted to make multiple quizzes, you would have to type out the same code multiple times. Fix this issue by refactoring your code into a method **RunQuiz()**. It should take two arguments: a **string[] array**of questions and **bool[] array**of answers. It should have the same behavior as your current app.
